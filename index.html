        <h1>Real Madrid</h1>
        <p class="main__paragraph">This is my favorite club. This is one of the richest and most titled clubs in the
            world. Real Madrid has
            won
            63 national titles: a record 35 Spanish champion titles, 19 Spanish Cups and 11 Spanish Super Cups. He
            holds
            the record for the number of wins in the Champions League (14 times). The best players of the planet
            have
            always played in this club, such as: C.Ronaldo, Z. Zidane, D. Beckham, R. Carlos and many others.</p>
        <h2>Chempions league</h2>
        <p class="main__paragraph">At the moment, Real Madrid has won the largest number of Champions League cups
            (14
            cups). To date, they are leading on the first line of Group F of the Champions League. They played the
            last
            match with Shakhtar Donetsk 1-1 and it was their first loss of points this year in the Champions League
            Cup. <strong>There was a very interesting and beautiful performance at this match.</strong>

            <h3>Clinical Real reign supreme in Clásico</h3>
            <p class="main__paragraph"><b>Real Madrid returned to the La Liga summit as they defeated Barcelona 3-1
                    in the 250th El Clásico.
                    The title holders avenged their loss at the Estadio Santiago Bernabéu in this fixture last
                    season
                    and inflicted the Blaugrana’s first defeat of the league campaign.</b></p>
            <p class="main__paragraph">At the moment, Real Madrid occupies the first place in the La Liga standings
                after
                beating Barcelona
                3-1. After a bruising draw with Inter Milan that left Barcelona’s UEFA Champions League hopes
                hanging by a thread, all eyes were on Xavi’s team selection for his 50th game in charge. Los Blancos
                clearly identified a weakness at right-back, targeting Sergi Roberto by utilising Vinícius Júnior’s
                pace in behind the Spaniard. That paid immediate dividends as Real took the lead after the Brazilian
                ran through on the left, forcing Marc-André ter Stegen into a save before Karim Benzema slammed home
                the rebound, ending a five-game scoreless streak in style.
            </p>
            <p class="main__paragraph">The visitors spurned a huge opportunity to equalise through Robert
                Lewandowski, but
                the usually
                lethal striker fluffed his lines. Raphinha’s low cross from the right picked out the Poland captain
                at the back post from point-blank range, but he uncharacteristically fired over. That miss would be
                punished emphatically by Carlo Ancelotti’s lethal champions, as a quick counter opened the defence,
                allowing Federico Valverde the room on the edge of the area to unleash a fierce drive that proved
                too hot to handle, sending Real in with a two-goal lead at the break.</p>
            <p class="main__paragraph">The hosts’ tactics were perfectly suited to protecting their advantage, and
                the
                Galacticos were happy
                enough to surrender the majority of possession and strike on the counter. Benzema netted soon after
                the restart, but Barcelona were saved by the offside flag. With more options on his bench, Xavi made
                three alterations on the hour mark in an attempt to tilt the scales in his favour, but his side’s
                chances looked bleak, with the first goalscorer going on to win each of the last seven Clásico
                editions played on this ground.</p>
